Affective Contextual Artificial Intelligence (ACAI)


ACAI is a novel architecture of emotional–contextual artificial intelligence combining affective computing, cybernetic feedback systems, cognitive dynamics, and modern generative models.
This document contains the official ACAI Whitepaper v1.0 overview, created as part of the Affective Cybernetics Research Project.


 
Whitepaper
Download ACAI_Whitepaper_v1.0.pdf (placed in repository)
The document describes the E–M–C architecture (Emotion–Mind–Context), affective dynamics, nonlinear regulation mechanisms, impulse modeling, and the integration of LLMs into an emotionally adaptive system.


 
Core Concepts of ACAI
- Affective Dynamics Core – nonlinear E–M–C emotional state model
- Affective Impulse Engine – valence-based impulse classification and transitions
- Contextual Mind Loop – adaptive policy generation for tone, style and safety
- Affective Translation Layer – emotion-preserving multilingual processing
- Ethical Charter (“For the Good of Love”) – transparent and empathic AI principles
- LLM Cognitive Core – GPT-based contextual reasoning and cognitive grounding

 
Annotated Bibliography

ACAI is inspired by foundational research in:
- Affective Computing: Picard, Cowie, Ekman, GoEmotions
- Cybernetics & Control Theory: Wiener, Ashby, Åström & Murray
- Cognitive Science & Psychology: Damasio, Frijda, Grossberg, LeDoux
- Modern AI: OpenAI Technical Reports, HuggingFace, MarianNMT, Google Research

 
Mission

To build a safe, empathic, resilient emotional AI system that supports human well-being, self-awareness, and acts “for the Good of Love.”

### 🔭 Future Direction

ACAI is evolving toward a fully integrated affective AI platform, combining:
- real-time emotional feedback systems  
- adaptive reasoning control for LLMs  
- embodied affective AI interfaces  
- scalable ACGM architectures  

The long-term vision is the creation of emotionally intelligent AI companions that support human development, well-being, and conscious interaction.
